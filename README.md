# Assignment 1
<!-- This one was the most brain-dead assignment I have done so far in my academic life. It consisted of recreating a scene given to us from sratch using only the `gIMatrix` library provided. The scene itself is something that one creates in MSPaint when one is wee and has just received access to the wonder that is a computer. I have no idea what this was supposed to test. Copy pasting skills? MSPaint appreciation? Managing frustration? The final code is an odd 1200 lines of code, and I dont feel like I really gained anything.Anyways the only interesting and mildly challenging part was creation of the circleBuffer. Although I dont understand why creation of other buffers was not allowed. A trapezium buffer would surely have helped. Anyways I digress into a rant. -->
